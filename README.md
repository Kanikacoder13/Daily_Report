# Daily Report
## Training day :- 01
I am **Kanika**. Today was my first day of summer training in the **Computer Science Department(Parent branch)** . I was very excited about this training . Firstly there was an **orientation program** conducted for us in the **auditorium** . Here , I interacted with **Dr. Priyanka** who is professor in **Computer Scienec department** . She gave all the necessary information that was required and also welcomed all the students who are going to be part of the parent branch . She told us about socities , attendance creteria and many other things . Then , I interacted with **Head of Department, Dr. Kiran Jyoti** along with all the students . She also introduced a new scheme for **2024 year onwards students**. After this valuable interaction , all the students shifted to their respective labs . In the lab , our teacher explained the syllabus of this training that all the students will study in further days . Then she said that first day we will discuss about **Linux**.
Firstly i learned about **Linux** & **its importance** then why most of the **companies** & **coders** use **Linux** over **Windows** ? Following are the reasons behind it :- 
- Linux is **more secure** due to its permission-based system and fewer malware targets than windows.
- Linux is **open source** , so it can be easily available.
- Linux is **free** , while windows required paid license.
- Linux has large community.

## Booting and its types 
I have also learned about booting and types-

### üñ•Ô∏è What is Booting?

**Booting** is the process of starting a computer.
When you switch on your computer, the system loads the operating system (like Windows or Linux) from the hard drive into the RAM (memory), so you can use the computer.

### üîÅ Booting Process :

1. **Power On** ‚Äì You turn on the computer.
2. **POST (Power-On Self-Test)** ‚Äì System checks hardware (RAM, keyboard, etc.).
3. **BIOS/UEFI Loads** ‚Äì Basic system firmware starts.
4. **Boot Loader Activated** ‚Äì BIOS/UEFI finds and runs the boot loader.
5. **OS Loading** ‚Äì Boot loader loads the operating system into RAM.
6. **System Ready** ‚Äì Operating system starts, and the computer is ready to use.

---

### üßæ Types of Booting:

üîÑ 1. **Cold Booting (Hard Booting):**

‚û° **Meaning**: Starting the computer when it is completely turned off.

   **Example**: You press the **power button** to turn on your computer after it was shut down ‚Äì that's **cold booting**.

üîÅ 2. **Warm Booting (Soft Booting)**:

‚û° **Meaning**: Restarting the computer without turning off the power.

   **Example**: You press **Ctrl + Alt + Del** or click **Restart** on Windows ‚Äì that's **warm booting**.

üîß 3. **Dual Booting**:

‚û° **Meaning**: Having **two operating systems** installed and choosing one to run.

  **Example**: Your laptop has Windows and Linux installed. At startup, you choose which one to use.

‚òÅÔ∏è 4. **Network Booting (PXE Booting)**:

‚û° **Meaning**: Booting a computer from a **network server** instead of **local storage**.

   **Example**: In a computer lab, systems boot from the college server using a LAN cable.

## Structure of Linux shell

![alt text](Linuxshell.png)

----

### Study of Kernel
The kernel is the core part of an operating system.

It manages the communication between hardware and software.

Also, it manages the following resources of the linux system :-

- Memory management
- File manangement
- Device management
- Process management
- I/O management etc

-----------------------------------

### Study of Shell

The shell is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the operating system.

It takes user commands and tells the operating system to perform tasks.

It lets you type commands to tell the computer what to do , like opening files , mananging programs.
 
 ### Types of Shell

Shells are mainly divided into two categories:

 **1. Command-Line Interface (CLI) Shells**

User interacts by typing commands

Fast and powerful for developers and system admins

Examples (Types of CLI Shells):

|Shell Name	|          Description                 |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|
|     sh	  |Bourne Shell (original Unix shell)    |
|    bash   |	Bourne Again Shell (most popular)    |
|   csh     |	      C Shell (C-like syntax)        |
|    ksh    |	   Korn Shell (advanced features)    |
|    zsh    |Z Shell (user-friendly & customizable)|


### üêö What is **Bash**?

**Bash** stands for **Bourne Again SHell**.
It is a **command-line shell** used in **Linux** and **Unix-based systems** to **interact with the operating system**.

---

### üîπ **Simple Definition:**

> **Bash** is a program that lets you **type commands** to control your computer without using the mouse.

---

### ‚úÖ **Key Features:**

* Used to **run commands** like creating files, copying, moving, or deleting.
* Supports **scripting**, so you can **automate tasks** with `.sh` files.
* Built-in on **Linux**, **macOS**, and available for **Windows** (via WSL or Git Bash).

---

### üß† **Example Bash Commands:**

```bash
ls       # list files
cd       # change directory
mkdir    # make a new folder
rm       # remove files/folders
echo     # print text
```

---

### üìú **Example of a Bash Script:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, Kanika!"
mkdir my_folder
cd my_folder
touch file.txt
```

---

### üîÅ **Why Bash is Important:**

* Core part of **Linux system administration**.
* Helps in **automation** (via shell scripting).
* Essential for **DevOps**, **ethical hacking**, **software development**, and more.

---

**2. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Shells**

User interacts using windows, icons, and buttons

Easy for beginners

**Example** : GNOME, KDE (on Linux)

----

## üìÅ Linux File System Structure 

A file system structure is the way an operating system organizes and manages data (files and folders) on a storage device like a hard disk or SSD.

It defines:

   * How files are stored

   * How folders (directories) are arranged

   * How the system keeps track of file locations and permissions

The Linux file system is organized **like a tree**, starting from the **root** directory `/`.  
All files and folders are inside this root, even if they are on different drives.

![alt text](struct.png)

The file system structure is like a **digital cabinet** that helps the OS and users **to keep data organized and easy to access**

### üå≥ Main Folders in Linux File System

| Directory | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `/`       | **Root** ‚Äì Starting point of the file system |
| `/bin`    | Essential **binaries** (like `ls`, `cp`, etc.) |
| `/boot`   | Files needed to **boot** the system |
| `/etc`    | System **configuration** files |
| `/home`   | Personal folders for **users** (like `/home/kanika`) |
| `/lib`    | Shared **libraries** for programs |
| `/media`  | Used to mount **USB drives, CDs** etc. |
| `/opt`    | **Optional software** packages |
| `/root`   | **Home directory** of the root user |
| `/sbin`   | System **admin commands** |
| `/tmp`    | Temporary files (auto-deleted) |
| `/usr`    | User-related programs and data |
| `/var`    | Variable data (like **logs**, mails) |

#### üìå Key Points

- The top-level directory is `/` (called **root**).
- Everything is organized under `/` like branches of a tree.
- Linux does **not** use drive letters like Windows (C:, D:) ‚Äî everything is part of the same tree.

  -----
  
## üíΩ What is Slash Full Disk in Linux?

In Linux, when someone says **"slash full disk"** or **"/ is full"**, it means the **root directory (`/`)** has **no free space left**.

### ‚úÖ What is `/` (Slash) in Linux?

- `/` is called the **root directory**.
- It is the **starting point** of the entire Linux file system.
- All other folders like `/home`, `/etc`, `/bin`, etc., exist inside `/`.

### üö® What Does "Slash Full Disk" Mean?

- The **main partition** of Linux (where it‚Äôs installed) is **completely full**.
- No space is available to save files, install software, or update the system.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Is It a Problem?

- System becomes **slow** or may **crash**.
- You can‚Äôt install or update software.
- Some apps and services may stop working.

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Check If `/` Is Full?
           df -h / 
        
------ 
           
üìå Quick Summary
|  Term  | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| / (Slash)|	Root directory (main Linux filesystem)|
|Slash Full Disk|	The root disk is full ‚Äì no free space left|

## üñ•Ô∏è What is Bare Metal Installation in Linux?

**Bare Metal Installation** means installing Linux **directly on a computer's hardware** ‚Äî not inside any other operating system or virtual machine.

You are installing Linux on a **fresh or empty computer**, just like installing Windows on a new laptop.

---

### ‚úÖ Why is it called "Bare Metal"?

Because the installation is done **on the actual physical machine** ‚Äî the "bare metal" ‚Äî without any layers like:

- No Windows
- No VirtualBox
- No VMware

---

**üõ†Ô∏è Simple Example: Installing Ubuntu on Bare Metal**

#### üìå Where Bare Metal is Used:

- In **servers** (no need for Windows)

### üíæ What is a **Partitioning Scheme**?

> A **partitioning scheme** is a method used to **organize a hard drive** into parts, so operating systems can manage and access data properly.

---

### üîπ **Why Partitioning is Needed?**

* To **install multiple OS** (e.g., Linux + Windows).
* To **separate system files and personal files**.
* For **better data management and backup**.
* To **improve performance** and **security**.

---

### üß± **Common Partitioning Schemes:**

| Scheme                           | Description                                   | Max Partitions | OS Support            |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| **MBR** (Master Boot Record)     | Older scheme, supports BIOS booting           | 4 primary      | Windows, Linux        |
| **GPT** (GUID Partition Table)   | Modern, supports UEFI booting and large disks | 128 primary    | Windows, Linux, macOS |
| **LVM** (Logical Volume Manager) | Used in Linux, flexible for resizing          | Dynamic        | Linux only            |

---

### üìå **Example:**

When you install Linux:

* You create a partition for **root (`/`)**
* One for **home (`/home`)**
* One for **swap**

That setup is based on a **Linux partitioning scheme**.

---

## üîê Linux File Permission Commands ‚Äì `chmod`, `chmod 444`, `chmod 644`, `chown`

Linux uses file permissions to control **who can read, write, or execute files and directories**. The `chmod` command allows us to modify these permissions. Every file and directory has **permissions** assigned to three types of users ‚Äî **owner(u)**, **group(g)**, and **others(o)**. These permissions determine whether a user can **read**, **write**, or **execute** the file.

---

### ‚úÖ **1. `chmod` (Change File Permissions)**
To **change file or directory permissions** in Linux for the owner, group, and others.

#### üî∏ **Syntax**:

```bash
chmod [permissions] [file_name]
```
**For example:** chmod + x filename.sh

## üîß `chmod +x filename.sh`

### üìò What Does It Do?
The command `chmod +x filename.sh` is used to **add execute permission** to a file (usually a script like `.sh`), so it can be **run as a program**.

---

### üîç Syntax Breakdown

| Component     | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `chmod`       | Stands for **Change Mode** ‚Äì used to change file permissions |
| `+x`          | Adds **execute** permission                                  |
| `filename.sh` | The name of the shell script file                            |

---

![alt text](++x.png)

![alt text](+x.png)


### ‚úÖ Purpose

This command makes a file **executable** by the **user, group, and others (by default)**.
You can then run the script directly using:

```bash
./filename.sh
```

Without execute permission, you'll see:

```
bash: ./filename.sh: Permission denied

```
### üí° Pro Tip

To give execute permission **only to the file owner**, use:

```bash
chmod u+x filename.sh
```
This is a safer option when sharing code in teams or on public systems.

---


#### üî¢ **Octal Permission Codes**:

| Number | Symbol | Meaning              |
| ------ | ------ | -------------------- |
| 7      | rwx    | Read, Write, Execute |
| 6      | rw-    | Read, Write          |
| 5      | r-x    | Read, Execute        |
| 4      | r--    | Read only            |
| 0      | ---    | No permissions       |

---

### üß™ **Examples**:

#### üîπ `chmod 444 file.txt`
To make a file **read-only** for everyone (owner, group, and others). Prevents editing or deletion.


```bash
chmod 444 file.txt
```

‚ü∂ `r-- r-- r--`



![alt text](chmod444.png)

![alt text](0.444.png)



#### üîπ `chmod 644 file.txt`

To allow the owner to **read and write**, and **group & others to only read**. Commonly used for text/config files.
üî∏ Now only the owner can edit, while others can only read the file.

```bash
chmod 644 file.txt
```

‚ü∂ `rw- r-- r--`

![alt text](chmod644.png)

![alt text](444.png)

### ‚úÖ **2. `chown` (Change File Owner)** [ASSIGNMENT]

`chown` changes the **owner** or **group** of a file or directory.

**Syntax**:
#### üî∏**change owner**:

```bash
chown [new_owner] [file_name]
```
![alt text](chown.png)

#### üî∏ **Change Owner and Group**:

```bash
chown user:group file.txt
```

‚úÖ **Examples**:

    chown kanika file.txt ‚Üí Changes the owner to kanika

    chown root:admin file.txt ‚Üí Changes owner to root and group to admin
---

### üìé **Check Permissions**:
‚úÖ *Tip*: Use ls -l to view current permissions:

 ```bash
 ls -l file.txt
 ```
---

> üîÅ **Quick Tip**:

> `chmod` = change permissions

> `chown` = change owner

**Point to remember**:

When working with system files, it's often necessary to use **sudo** to **execute chmod** with root privileges.

---
## üîÑ Redirection in Linux

In Linux, **redirection** is a powerful feature used to control **input and output** of commands. It allows you to **save output to files, read from files, or even combine and filter output streams**. This is widely used in scripting and system automation. Redirection operator is ">"

### üîÑ Types of Redirection in Linux

Redirection is used in Linux to control where input comes from and where output or error messages go. It helps in saving outputs to files, reading inputs from files, and managing errors effectively.

--

| **Operator** | **Meaning**                    | **Example**                        | **Result**                                             |
|--------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `>`          | Output redirection             | `ls > files.txt`                   | Saves output to `files.txt` (overwrites if it exists)  |
| `>>`         | Append output                  | `echo "Hello" >> notes.txt`        | Adds `"Hello"` to end of `notes.txt`                  |
| `<`          | Input redirection              | `wc -l < notes.txt`                | Reads input from `notes.txt` instead of keyboard       |

> üß† **Tip**: Use redirection to log outputs, handle errors gracefully, and automate input/output in shell scripts.

## üì¢ `echo` Command in Linux

The `echo` command is used to **display text, strings, or variables** on the terminal. It‚Äôs one of the most commonly used commands in **shell scripting, logging, and debugging**.

---

### ‚úÖ What Does `echo` Do?

- Prints **text or output** to the screen.
- Displays the value of **environment variables**.
- Writes output to **files using redirection**.

## üö∞ Pipe (`|`) in Linux

In Linux, the **pipe operator (`|`)** is used to **pass the output of one command as input to another**.  
It helps you build powerful command chains by combining simple commands to perform complex tasks.

---

### ‚úÖ What Does a Pipe Do?

- Connects **stdout (output)** of one command to the **stdin (input)** of another.
- Helps create efficient **one-liners** without the need for intermediate files.
- Commonly used in **filtering**, **sorting**, **counting**, and **processing data**.

---

### üìå Syntax:

```bash
command1 | command2
````

‚û° The output of `command1` becomes the input of `command2`.

---
**Example**: sort ‚Äì Sort file content

    cat file.txt | sort

‚úÖ What it does:

  - Reads the content of file.txt
  - Sorts the lines alphabetically using sort

üì§ Output:
Sorted version of the file content, line by line.

### üß† Pro Tips:

* Pipes work **left to right**: output of the left command goes to the right.

* You can **chain multiple pipes**

## üì¶ File Compression

File compression is the process of **reducing the size of a file or group of files**. This is done to save storage space or make files easier and faster to transfer over the internet.

**üß† Why Compress Files?**

    ‚úÖ Saves disk space

    ‚úÖ Speeds up file transfer

    ‚úÖ Reduces bandwidth usage

    ‚úÖ Helps in organizing multiple files together (archiving)

### üì¶ File Compression using `gzip`

`gzip` (GNU zip) is a popular **lossless file compression** utility used mainly in **Linux/Unix** systems. It uses the **DEFLATE** algorithm to reduce file size without losing data.

### üîç Purpose of `gzip`

- Reduce file size to save disk space
- Speed up file transfer (especially over networks)
- Commonly used with `tar` for folder compression (`.tar.gz`)

---

### üîß Basic Syntax & Usage

#### üëâ Compress a file

**gzip filename**

 * Compresses filename to filename.gz

 * Output: filename.gz

 * By default, replaces the original file

### üëâ Decompress a file

**gunzip filename.gz**

 * Restores the original `filename`

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Common `gzip` Options

| Option | Description                              |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `-d`   | Decompress (same as `gunzip`)            |
| `-k`   | Keep the original file after compression |
| `-r`   | Compress files recursively (folders)     |
| `-v`   | Verbose ‚Äì show the compression process   |
| `-l`   | Display compression statistics/info      |

### üî∏ Example:

**gzip -kv myfile.txt**

* Compresses `myfile.txt` to `myfile.txt.gz`
* Keeps the original file
* Displays compression details

#### üìÅ Compressing Folders using 'tar' + 'gzip'

Since gzip works on **individual files**, use 'tar' to archive folders first:

#### üëâ Compress a directory:

'tar -czvf archive.tar.gz foldername/'
   
  * c: Create archive

  * z: Compress using gzip

  * v: Verbose

  * f: Output file name

### üëâ Extract .tar.gz archive:

'tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz'

### ‚úÖ Advantages of `gzip`

* Fast and efficient
* Widely available on Linux systems
* Ideal for logs, backups, and file distribution

---

### üìö Bonus Tip (Check Compression Info)

**gzip -l filename.gz**

* Shows original size, compressed size, and compression ratio.

## üêß Wildcards ( globbing characters) in Linux

**Wildcards** are special characters used in Linux shell (like Bash) to represent **multiple files or patterns**. They make it easier to **search, match, or operate on files/directories** without typing full names.

### üîë Why Use Wildcards?

| ‚úÖ Benefit                  |     üîç Description                           |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Save time**               | Operate on multiple files with one command    |
| **Flexible file selection** | Match files by patterns (e.g., extensions)    |
| **Automation**              | Useful in scripting and batch operations      |

---
## üêß Wildcards in Linux 

| Wildcard | Meaning                                      | Example Command                        | Matches / Description                               |
|----------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `*`      | Matches **zero or more** characters          | `ls *.txt`                             | Lists all files ending with `.txt`                  |
| `?`      | Matches **exactly one** character            | `rm file?.sh`                          | Deletes files like `file1.sh`, `fileA.sh`          |
| `[ ]`    | Matches **one character** inside brackets    | `cp file[1-3].txt backup/`             | Copies `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, `file3.txt`       |
| `[^ ]`   | Matches **one character not** in brackets    | `ls file[^0-9].txt`                    | Lists files like `filea.txt`, `file_.txt`          |
| `{}`     | Matches **comma-separated patterns**         | `ls file.{txt,jpg}`                    | Matches `file.txt`, `file.jpg`                     |
| Combined | Use multiple wildcards together              | `ls log_[0-9]*.log`                    | Matches `log_1.log`, `log_22.log`, `log123.log`    |

---

### üö´ Caution

Always **double-check** with `echo` or `ls` before using `rm` with wildcards:

  * 'echo *.txt'  # safe check before deleting
  
  * 'rm *.txt'  # ‚Üê Use only if you're sure

---

### üìö Bonus Tip: Escaping wildcards

If you want to **treat wildcards as normal characters**, use **backslash (`\`)** or quotes:

'echo "*.txt"'      # Prints *.txt
' echo \*.txt'       # Same result

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Escaping Characters in Linux (Shell) [ASSIGNMENT]

In Linux shell (like **bash**), **special characters** (such as `*`, `$`, `"`, `'`, `\`) have **special meanings**. To use them as **normal text**, we need to **escape** them.

## üîë Why Escape Characters?

| Purpose                            | Example                          |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Prevent shell from interpreting them | Show `*` as literal asterisk     |
| Include spaces or special chars in file names | Handle `My File.txt` correctly |
| Use variables literally (not expand `$`) | Display `$HOME` as text         |

----

## ‚öôÔ∏è Common Escape Methods

| Method       | Description                                 | Example                     | Output / Use Case                  |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `\` (backslash) | Escapes the next character                  | `echo \$HOME`               | Prints `$HOME` as text             |
| `' '` (single quotes) | Prevents **all** expansion (strong quoting) | `echo '$USER'`             | Prints `$USER` as-is               |
| `" "` (double quotes) | Allows variable expansion but blocks most others | `echo "Hello $USER"`     | Expands `$USER`, treats space as literal |
| `\\`         | Escapes a backslash                          | `echo "\\"`                 | Prints `\`                         |
| `\n`, `\t`   | Escapes for newline and tab in `echo -e`     | `echo -e "Line1\nLine2"`    | Prints on two lines                |

---


## üß™ Examples

### üëâ Prevent wildcard expansion:

* echo \*.txt

üì§ Output: `*.txt`

### üëâ Show a dollar sign without expanding the variable:

* echo \$PATH

üì§ Output: `$PATH`

### üëâ Use quotes to handle spaces:

* touch "My File.txt"

* ls My\ File.txt

---

## üìù Quoting in Linux [ASSIGNMENT] 

In Linux, **quoting** is used to protect **special characters**, **spaces**, and **variables** from being changed or expanded by the shell.

### üìå Why Use Quoting?

| Reason                  | Example                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| To protect spaces       | `My File.txt` ‚Üí `"My File.txt"` |
| To stop variable expansion | `$HOME` ‚Üí `'$HOME'`           |
| To safely use symbols   | `$`, `*`, `&`, etc.              |

---

## üîí Types of Quotes

| Quote Type      | Use                     | Example                | Output                     |
|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| `'single quotes'` | Everything inside stays **exactly the same** | `echo '$HOME'`     | `$HOME` (not expanded)     |
| `"double quotes"` | Expands **variables**, but protects spaces | `echo "My home is $HOME"` | My home is /home/user      |
| `\ backslash`     | Escapes **one special character**     | `echo \$HOME`         | `$HOME` (not expanded)     |

---

## üìö Examples

### üëâ Handling spaces:

* touch "My File.txt"
* ls My\ File.txt


### üëâ Protecting variables:

* echo '$USER'
Output: $USER

* echo "$USER"
Output: your_username

---

> ‚úÖ Tip: Always use quotes when your file names have spaces or special characters.

### üêö What is Shell Scripting?

**Shell scripting** is writing a **series of Linux/Unix commands** in a **text file** (called a script) so they can be **executed together automatically** by the shell.

üß† In Simple Words:

 A **shell script** is like a **recipe** ‚Äî instead of typing each step (command) manually, you write them all in a file and run the file.

 ### Hardware


## üß† 1. What is Computer Hardware?

Hardware refers to the **physical components** of a computer ‚Äî things you can **see and touch** like CPU, motherboard, RAM, hard disk, ports, etc.

----

## üß† 2. Motherboard ‚Äì Central Hub of the System

The **motherboard** is the main printed circuit board that connects all parts of a computer.

### Basic Structure of a Motherboard

The motherboard is a flatboard made of printed circuits. It has many small parts on it. These parts include slots, sockets, and connectors. Each section of the motherboard has a specific role. **For example**:

  - The **CPU socket** holds the central processing unit (CPU).
  - RAM slots are used for memory modules.
  - Other connectors help attach storage devices and graphics cards.

![alt text](motherboard.png)

### Function of Motherboard

The primary function of a motherboard is to provide a central platform where different components like the processor (CPU), memory modules (RAM), storage drives (HDD/SSD), and expansion cards can be integrated and work together seamlessly. It manages the data, instructions, and power flow between these connected devices.

In simpler terms, you can think of a motherboard as the command centre that allows the different parts of a computer to talk to each other and function as a complete system. It houses vital components like the CPU socket (where the processor is installed), memory slots (for RAM modules), and various ports/interfaces to connect peripherals. The motherboard also distributes power from the power supply unit (PSU) to all the connected components.

### üî∑ Key Components

| Component              | Description                                   |

### ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Booting Process (Power ON to OS)

1. Power goes to ROM
2. **Bootstrap loader** is activated
3. OS is copied from **Hard Disk ‚Üí RAM**
4. CPU starts processing via **registers** and **cache**

> ‚úÖ This startup process is called **Booting**

---

### üîå What Happens When You Power On Your PC (Hardware Level)

1. **Power supply starts**  
   - Sends power to all components.

2. **CPU wakes up**  
   - Looks for instructions from BIOS/UEFI.

3. **BIOS/UEFI runs**  
   - Performs POST (Power-On Self-Test) to check hardware.

4. **Boot device is found**  
   - Searches for a bootable device like SSD/HDD.

5. **Bootloader is loaded**  
   - Loads a small program into RAM.

6. **Operating system starts loading**  
   - The OS kernel takes control and the system starts.

#### üñ•Ô∏è What is a Host in Networking?

A **host** is any device that connects to a **network** and can **send or receive data**.

##### üí° Simple Definition:
> A **host** is a device on a network that has an **IP address** and can **communicate with other devices**.

![alt text](h.png)

##### ‚úÖ Examples of Hosts:
- Computers (laptops/desktops)
- Smartphones
- Servers
- Printers
- Smart TVs
- Any device with an **IP address**

![alt text](hdevices.png)

---

**IoT (Internet of Things)** is a network of **connected physical devices** that can collect, send, and receive data over the **internet** without human involvement.

 Also any **Internet of Things (IoT)** devices
- TV
- Thermometers
- Speakers
- Lights
- Smart Watches
- Refrigerator

---

##### üß† Key Points:
- Every host must have a **unique IP address**
- Hosts can be:
  - **Clients** (e.g., your PC)
  - **Servers** (e.g., Google‚Äôs web server)
- Hosts can **send**, **receive**, or **request** information

---
##### üß† In IP addressing:
- The **network part** of the IP address identifies the **network**.
- The **host part** identifies the **specific device** in that network.

##### üìå Example:

**IP Address:** `192.168.1.10`  
**Subnet Mask:** `255.255.255.0`

- **Network part:** `192.168.1`
- **Host part:** `10`

‚û°Ô∏è So, `10` is the **host ID**, which means it's the 10th device on the `192.168.1` network.

#### üìò Notations in Networking

In networking, **notations** are the way **IP addresses** and **subnet masks** are written and represented so that computers and people can understand and process them easily.
In networking, IP addresses can be represented in different notations:

1. **Binary Notation** üß† (Used by computers)
2. **Dotted Decimal Notation** üìç (Used by humans)
3. **CIDR Notation** üßæ (Used for subnetting)

---

##### üîπ 1. **Binary Notation**

###### ‚úÖ What is it?

* Every **IP address** is actually stored and processed in **binary form** (0s and 1s) by computers.
* Each of the 4 parts (called **octets**) in an IPv4 address is represented as an **8-bit binary number**.

###### üîÅ Conversion Trick: Decimal ‚ûù Binary
Use **division by 2** and write the remainders **in reverse**.

###### üìå Example:

Let‚Äôs take the IP address:

**`192.168.1.1`**

In **binary notation**, this is:

192    = 11000000  
168    = 10101000  
1      = 00000001  
1      = 00000001

So the full binary IP address is:

**`11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001`**

---

##### üîπ 2. **Dotted Decimal Notation**

###### ‚úÖ What is it?

* This is the **most common format** used by humans.
* An IPv4 address is written as **four decimal numbers separated by dots**, where each number is the **decimal version of 8 binary bits** (1 byte).

## üîÅ Conversion Trick: Binary ‚ûù Decimal
Use **place values**:  

Multiply each binary digit by powers of 2 (from right to left), then **add all**.

###### üìå Example:

Binary:
`11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001`

Convert each part to decimal:


11000000 ‚Üí 192  
10101000 ‚Üí 168  
00000001 ‚Üí 1  
00000001 ‚Üí 1

So the **dotted decimal notation** is:

**`192.168.1.1`**

---

##### üîπ 3. **CIDR Notation (Bonus)**

> CIDR stands for **Classless Inter-Domain Routing**
> It is another way to show an IP address **with subnet mask**.
> CIDR combines **IP address + subnet mask** in a compact way.

###### üß† CIDR Conversion Trick:

| CIDR Notation | Subnet Mask          |
|---------------|----------------------|
| /8            | 255.0.0.0            |
| /16           | 255.255.0.0          |
| /24           | 255.255.255.0        |
| /32           | 255.255.255.255      |

---

###### üìå Format: 

IP_address/subnet_bits

**Example:**
`192.168.1.1/24`
üëâ Means: First 24 bits are **network**, and remaining 8 are **host**.

---

#### ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Notation Type       | Format Example                        | Description                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Binary Notation** | `11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001` | IP in binary, understood by computers   |
| **Dotted Decimal**  | `192.168.1.1`                         | IP in human-readable form               |
| **CIDR Notation**   | `192.168.1.1/24`                      | IP + subnet info for routing/networking |

---


#### üßæ IP Classes (Classful Addressing)

##### ‚úÖ What is Classful Addressing?

**Classful Addressing** is a system used in early internet networking to divide the IPv4 address space into **5 predefined classes**: A, B, C, D, and E.

Each IP address was split into two parts:
- **Prefix (Network ID):** Identifies the **network**.
- **Suffix (Host ID):** Identifies the **device/node** within that network.

This structure was used to decide how many **networks** and **hosts per network** could exist.

---

###### üß© Structure of IP Address

An **IPv4 address** is 32 bits long, written in 4 octets (like: `192.168.1.1`).

**Example** : 192.168.0.1 ‚Üí 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001

Each address = **Network ID (prefix)** + **Host ID (suffix)**

![alt text](classdist.png)

IPv4 addresses are divided into 5 **Classes** based on their first number.

#### üåê DNS and MAC Address

#####  ‚úÖ DNS (Domain Name System)

- **Definition**: DNS converts domain names (like `www.google.com`) into IP addresses (like `142.250.182.14`).
- **Purpose**: Helps users access websites using names instead of IP numbers.
- **How it works**:
  1. You enter a website name.
  2. DNS finds the IP address of that website.
  3. Browser connects to the correct server using that IP.

- **Example**:

[www.google.com](http://www.google.com) ‚Üí 142.250.182.14

---

##### ‚úÖ MAC Address (Media Access Control)

- **Definition**: A MAC address is a **unique identifier** assigned to a device's **network interface card (NIC)**.
- **Used in**: Local area networks (LAN) for device identification.
- **Format**: 6 pairs of hexadecimal digits (48-bit).
- Example: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`

- **Key Points**:
- Permanent (burned into hardware)
- Used for communication inside a network
- Helps routers and switches direct data correctly

#### üö™ Default Gateway

##### ‚úÖ What is a Default Gateway?

- A **Default Gateway** is a device (usually a **router**) that connects your local network to **external networks**, such as the internet.
- It acts as an **exit point** for devices to send data **outside their network**.

---

###### üìå Why is it important?

- Without a default gateway, devices can **only communicate within the same local network**.
- It allows communication with **other networks or the internet**.

###### üß† Example:

- Suppose your PC has IP: `192.168.1.10`
- Your router (default gateway) has IP: `192.168.1.1`

> When your PC wants to access `www.google.com`, it sends the request to `192.168.1.1` (default gateway), which forwards it to the internet.

---

#### üóÇÔ∏è Default Gateway vs IP Address

| Feature         | IP Address                 | Default Gateway             |
|-----------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Identity        | Unique to the device       | Common for all in network   |
| Purpose         | Used to identify the device| Used to route external traffic|
| Example         | `192.168.1.10`             | `192.168.1.1`                |

---

> ‚úÖ **Tip**: The Default Gateway is usually the **IP address of your router**.

-----

#### üõ†Ô∏è Subnetting (Very Important)

##### üìå What is it?

It helps you to utilize your network bandwidth more intelligently.

The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting.

> Subnetting means breaking a big network into smaller parts.
 
##### ‚úÖ Why we need it?

- To use IP addresses more efficiently.
- To increase security and control.

##### üìò Subnet Mask

| Class | Subnet Mask        |
|-------|---------------------|
| A     | `255.0.0.0`         |
| B     | `255.255.0.0`       |
| C     | `255.255.255.0`     |

##### üéØ Example:

> IP Address: `205.150.65.0/26`

- `/26` ‚Üí Means 26 bits are for network, 6 bits for host.

##### Calculations:
- **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.192`
- **No. of Subnets**: `2^2 = 4`
- **No. of Hosts/Subnet**: `2^6 - 2 = 62`
- **Network IP**: `205.150.65.0`
- **Broadcast IP**: `205.150.65.63`

---

#### üìä Bandwidth and Latency

- **Bandwidth**: Speed of data transfer (measured in bps) or 
It is the rate at which data is actually transmitted over the network .

- **Latency**: Time delay during data transfer from source to destination .

---

#### üåê Network IP and Broadcast IP 

---

##### ‚úÖ Network IP (Network Address)

- It is the **first IP address** in a network.
- It is used to **identify the whole network**.
- It does **not belong to any device**.
- **Example**: `192.168.1.0` ‚Üí means the 192.168.1 network.

---

##### ‚úÖ Broadcast IP (Broadcast Address)

- It is the **last IP address** in a network.
- It is used to **send a message to all devices** in the network.
- It does **not belong to any one device**.
- **Example**: `192.168.1.255` ‚Üí message goes to all devices in 192.168.1.x

### üß† What is DHCP?

##### ‚úÖ DHCP ‚Äì Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

##### üìå Definition:
**DHCP** is a network protocol that **automatically gives IP addresses** to devices (like your phone, computer, etc.) when they connect to a network.

##### üîß Why is DHCP used?

- To **avoid manual IP configuration**.
- To **save time** and **reduce mistakes**.
- Makes it **easy to manage** IPs in big networks

##### üß† How it works (Simple Steps):

1. You connect your device to Wi-Fi.
2. Your device asks for an IP address.
3. The **DHCP server** picks a free IP and gives it to your device.
4. You are now connected to the network and internet!

##### üìé Example:

- You connect your laptop to Wi-Fi.
- DHCP gives it IP: `192.168.1.5`
- Next time, it may give a different IP like `192.168.1.8`

##### üßæ Key Terms:

| Term         | Meaning                              |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| DHCP Server  | The device (router or server) that gives IP addresses |
| DHCP Client  | The device (your phone, PC, etc.) that gets an IP     |

##### üîÑ Without DHCP vs With DHCP

| Action           | Manual IP (No DHCP) | DHCP (Automatic)      |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Set IP Address   | You do it manually  | Given automatically   |
| Easy to Use?     | ‚ùå No                | ‚úÖ Yes                |
| Error chances    | High                | Low                   |

> ‚úÖ **In Simple Words**: DHCP is like an **auto-assign system** that gives an IP address to each device, so you don‚Äôt have to do it yourself.

### üõ†Ô∏è Networking Commands: `ping`, `traceroute`, `ifconfig`

#### ‚úÖ 1. `ping` Command

##### üìå What is it?
`ping` checks if another computer or website is reachable and shows how long the data takes to travel there and back.

##### üß† Technical Meaning:
It sends small data packets (ICMP echo requests) to a target IP or domain, and waits for a reply.

##### üß™ Example Command:

ping google.com

> **On windows**

![alt text](ping1.png)

![alt text](ping4.png)

> **On Linux**

![alt text](pingcp.png)


##### üìå Real-Life Example:

> You're not able to open Google on your browser. You run `ping google.com` to check if your computer can reach Google‚Äôs servers. If it replies, the problem is not with your internet.

##### ‚úÖ Use:

* To test internet or network connection
* To see if a server is **up or down**

---

## üìå What is "64 bytes" in ping?

- When we use the `ping` command, it sends a **data packet** to the target.
- That packet is usually **64 bytes in size**.
- It means: **64 bytes of data were sent and received successfully**.

### üß™ Example:

ping google.com

Output:

64 bytes from 142.250.182.14: time = 25 ms

> This shows your computer sent a **64-byte packet** to Google, and it replied in **25 ms**.

---

## üìå What is Loopback?

* **Loopback** means sending data **to your own computer**.
* It is used to **test your network setup locally**.
* The loopback IP address is : 127.0.0.1
* Also called **localhost**.

### üß™ Example:

ping 127.0.0.1

> This checks if your PC‚Äôs network system is working properly (no need for internet).


## üéØ Summary

| Term        | Meaning                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| 64 bytes    | Size of ping packet       |
| Loopback    | Testing your own computer |
| Loopback IP | `127.0.0.1` (localhost)   |

---

#### ‚úÖ 2. `traceroute` / `tracert` Command

##### üìå What is it?

It shows the path (all the routers or hops) that your data travels through to reach a website.

##### üß† Technical Meaning:

Sends packets with increasing TTL (Time To Live) and shows each router between your device and the final server.

##### üß™ Example Command:

traceroute google.com      # On Linux/macOS

![alt text](traceroute.png)

tracert google.com         # On Windows

![alt text](tracertcp.png)


##### üìå Real-Life Example:

> A website is working for your friend but not for you. You run `tracert` to see where your request is getting delayed or blocked ‚Äî maybe a router between you and the site is down.

> Think of traceroute like **tracking a courier package**.

 Each stop (hop) it passes through is like a delivery center.
 
 Traceroute shows **each stop**, and **how long** it took to reach there.
 
##### üîç Use Cases of traceroute

* Diagnose where a connection is slow or failing
* Identify routing problems in networks
* See how many hops it takes to reach a website
* Understand how data travels on the internet

#### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Asterisks (`*`) in Traceroute ‚Äì Meaning & Interpretation

##### üìå Meaning:
- Asterisks appear when the router **does not respond** within the time limit.
- It shows a **timeout** for that attempt.


##### üìñ Interpretation:

| Output            | Interpretation                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `*  *  *`         | No response from the router at that hop         |
| `12 ms  *  14 ms` | Responded to 1st and 3rd attempt only            |
| Multiple `* * *` rows | Could mean a **firewall** or **unreachable hop** |
| All hops = `*`    | Likely a **major network issue** or **blocked path** |

> ‚úÖ **Note**: Some routers are **configured to ignore traceroute** ‚Äî so occasional asterisks are normal.
> ‚úÖ **Tip**: 
Use ping to check if a site is reachable.
Use traceroute to see how it's being reached and where delays happen.

### üåê Ethernet 

#### ‚úÖ What is Ethernet?

- Ethernet is a **wired communication technology** used in **Local Area Networks (LANs)** to connect devices like PCs, switches, and routers.
- It allows devices to **send and receive data using physical cables** (usually Cat5e or Cat6).
- It follows the **IEEE 802.3 standard**.

##### üß† Real-Life Analogy

> Think of Ethernet like **city roads**:

- Cars = Data packets  
- Roads = Ethernet cables  
- Houses = Computers  
- Traffic lights = Switches/Routers  

Ethernet allows computers to **send and receive data** safely and efficiently ‚Äî just like cars traveling on proper roads.

##### üëÄ What Does Ethernet Look Like?

##### üîå Cable:
- Looks like a thick telephone wire.
- Usually has **RJ45 connectors** on both ends.
- Labeled as **Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a**, etc.

##### üî≤ Port:
- Found on desktops, laptops, routers.
- A square port labeled as ‚ÄúLAN‚Äù or with this symbol: `<>`

---

##### ‚öôÔ∏è How Ethernet Works :

1. Devices are connected to a **switch or router** using Ethernet cables.
2. Each device has a **unique MAC address**.
3. When data is sent, the switch/router checks the **destination MAC** and forwards it to the correct device.
4. Communication happens at very **high speed**, with **low errors**.

##### üß™ Where is Ethernet Used?

- Homes: Wired internet
- Offices: LAN networks
- Gaming: Stable, fast connection
- CCTV: For camera and DVR connection
- Servers & data centers: High-speed networking

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language used to create web pages.  
It defines the **structure and layout** of content using **tags**.

- Not a programming language, but a **markup language**.
- HTML files have a `.html` extension.

---

#### ‚úÖ What Does HTML Do?

- Creates the **structure** of a web page.
- Organizes content using elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
- Acts as the **skeleton** of a web page.
- It works along with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for functionality).

---

#### ‚úÖ How Does a Browser Render HTML?

1. Browser loads the `.html` file.
2. It reads the HTML **line-by-line** from top to bottom.
3. Builds a **DOM (Document Object Model)** in memory.
4. Converts HTML tags into **visual elements** on the screen.
5. Processes linked CSS for styling and JavaScript for functionality.

**Example:**  
When the browser sees `<h1>Hello</h1>`, it renders **Hello** as a big heading.


#### ‚úÖ Basic Structure of an HTML Document

#### ‚úÖ Explanation of Each Part

| Part              | Description                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `<!DOCTYPE html>` | Declares the HTML version (HTML5).           |
| `<html>`          | Root of the document. All content goes here. |
| `<head>`          | Meta information (title, links, charset).    |
| `<title>`         | Title shown in the browser tab.              |
| `<body>`          | Contains visible content on the web page.    |
| `<h1>`            | Largest heading, used for main titles.       |
| `<p>`             | Paragraph element.                           |

#### ‚úÖ Structure of HTML (Tree View)

![alt text](part.png)

#### ‚úÖ Summary Points

* HTML defines **what** content appears on a webpage.
* A **browser renders** HTML into visible structure.
* Tags are used in **pairs**: `<tag>` ... `</tag>`.
* Structure includes: `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.

### üåê Introduction to HTML & Web Basics

#### ‚úÖ What is HTML?

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language used to create web pages. It structures content using **tags** that the browser can interpret.

---

#### üîñ Common HTML Tags

##### 1. Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
- Used to define titles and subheadings.
- `<h1>` is the largest, `<h6>` is the smallest.

```html
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
````

##### 2. Paragraph (`<p>`)

* Represents a block of text.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```


##### 3. Lists

##### üî∏ Unordered List (`<ul>`) ‚Äì Bullet Points

```html
<ul>
  <li>Apple</li>
  <li>Banana</li>
</ul>
```

##### üî∏ Ordered List (`<ol>`) ‚Äì Numbered

```html
<ol>
  <li>First Step</li>
  <li>Second Step</li>
</ol>
```

##### 4. Links (`<a>`)

* Used to create clickable hyperlinks.
* `href` attribute defines the URL.

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com">Visit Google</a>
```

##### 5. Images (`<img>`)

* Used to display images on a web page.
* `src` specifies the image path, `alt` gives alternative text.

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">
```

##### Using above HTML tags 

![alt text](htmltags.png)

![alt text](runn.png)

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Notes:

* All tags are enclosed in **angle brackets**: `< >`.
* Some tags need **opening and closing** (e.g., `<p></p>`), while some are **self-closing** (e.g., `<img>`).
* HTML is not case-sensitive but is recommended to be written in **lowercase**.

## Training day :- 11

### üìò 1. Forms and Input Types in HTML

#### üîπ What is a Form?
An **HTML form** is used to collect user input and send it to a server for processing. It is defined using the `<form>` tag.

```html
<form action="/submit" method="post">
  <!-- input elements go here -->
</form>
````

* `action`: The server URL where form data will be sent.
* `method`: Defines how form data is sent ‚Äì `GET` or `POST`.

---

### üîπ HTML Form Methods: `GET` vs `POST`

| Feature       | `GET` Method                         | `POST` Method                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Data Location | Appended in URL (visible)            | Sent in request body (invisible)  |
| Use Case      | Safe data like search, filters       | Sensitive data like passwords     |
| Length Limit  | Limited to URL length (\~2048 chars) | No size limit (depends on server) |
| Security      | Less secure                          | More secure                       |
| Example URL   | `/submit?name=John&email=test@x.com` | Data is hidden from URL           |

‚úÖ Use `GET` for search/filter forms and `POST` for login or data submission forms.

---

### üîπ Common Input Types

| Input Type | Description                   | Example                   |

## üìò 3. CSS Styling: Inline, Internal & External

### üîπ What is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML elements. It controls layout, color, fonts, spacing, and more.

There are **three ways to apply CSS**:

### ‚úÖ Inline CSS

* Applied directly to an HTML element using the `style` attribute.
* Best for quick, one-time styling.

```html
<p style="color: green; font-size: 18px;">This is styled text.</p>
```

### ‚úÖ Internal CSS

* Defined inside a `<style>` tag within the `<head>` of an HTML file.
* Useful for styling a single web page.

```html
<head>
  <style>
    body {
      background-color: #f0fff0;
      font-family: Arial;
    }
    h1 {
      color: darkgreen;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

### ‚úÖ External CSS

* Written in a separate `.css` file.
* Linked to the HTML file using the `<link>` tag.
* Recommended for styling multiple pages consistently.

**HTML File:**

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

**styles.css File:**

```css
body {
  background-color: #e6ffe6;
  font-family: Verdana;
}
h1 {
  color: seagreen;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### üîπ Comparison Table

| Feature     | Inline CSS             | Internal CSS                 | External CSS               |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Location    | Inside HTML element    | Inside `<style>` in `<head>` | In separate `.css` file    |
| Scope       | One element only       | Whole single HTML page       | Multiple HTML files        |
| Reusability | ‚ùå No                   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited                   | ‚úÖ High                     |
| Use Case    | Quick fixes or testing | Small websites or one-pagers | Full websites / many pages |

### üìò Module 4: Introduction to Git and Version Control

---

## üî∂ What is Git and Why Use Version Control?

### üîπ What is Git?
**Git** is a **distributed version control system (VCS)** used to track changes in source code and collaborate on software projects. It helps developers work together efficiently, even on large and complex projects.

### üîπ What is Version Control?
**Version control** is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time, so you can recall specific versions later.

### ‚úÖ Benefits of Using Git & Version Control:
- Keep history of all changes.
- Collaborate with teams efficiently.
- Rollback to previous versions if something breaks.
- Work on multiple features simultaneously (branches).
- Avoid overwriting each other's work.

---
## üîπ Why is Git Open Source?

Git is open-source because it is licensed under the **GNU General Public License (GPL)**. This allows anyone to **freely use, modify, and share** it. Being open-source encourages global collaboration, fast development, and secure improvements by the community.

---

## üîπ Why Must Future Coders Learn Git?

Future coders must learn Git because it is a **crucial skill in software development**. It helps track code changes, supports **team collaboration**, ensures safe coding practices, and is widely used in the **tech industry**. Most coding jobs require Git knowledge.


## üî∂ Git Architecture: Repository, Working Tree, Index

![alt text](gitarchi.jpg)

Git uses a **three-layer architecture**:

| Component              | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Repository (repo)**  | A `.git` directory that stores the entire history and configuration of the project. |
| **Working Tree**       | The current checked-out version of the project files (what you see and edit). |
| **Index (Staging Area)** | A space where changes are prepared before making a permanent commit. |
