# Daily Report
## Training day :- 01
I am **Kanika**. Today was my first day of summer training in the **Computer Science Department(Parent branch)** . I was very excited about this training . Firstly there was an **orientation program** conducted for us in the **auditorium** . Here , I interacted with **Dr. Priyanka** who is professor in **Computer Scienec department** . She gave all the necessary information that was required and also welcomed all the students who are going to be part of the parent branch . She told us about socities , attendance creteria and many other things . Then , I interacted with **Head of Department, Dr. Kiran Jyoti** along with all the students . She also introduced a new scheme for **2024 year onwards students**. After this valuable interaction , all the students shifted to their respective labs . In the lab , our teacher explained the syllabus of this training that all the students will study in further days . Then she said that first day we will discuss about **Linux**.
Firstly i learned about **Linux** & **its importance** then why most of the **companies** & **coders** use **Linux** over **Windows** ? Following are the reasons behind it :- 
- Linux is **more secure** due to its permission-based system and fewer malware targets than windows.
- Linux is **open source** , so it can be easily available.
- Linux is **free** , while windows required paid license.
- Linux has large community.

## Booting and its types 
I have also learned about booting and types-

### 🖥️ What is Booting?

**Booting** is the process of starting a computer.
When you switch on your computer, the system loads the operating system (like Windows or Linux) from the hard drive into the RAM (memory), so you can use the computer.

### 🔁 Booting Process :

1. **Power On** – You turn on the computer.
2. **POST (Power-On Self-Test)** – System checks hardware (RAM, keyboard, etc.).
3. **BIOS/UEFI Loads** – Basic system firmware starts.
4. **Boot Loader Activated** – BIOS/UEFI finds and runs the boot loader.
5. **OS Loading** – Boot loader loads the operating system into RAM.
6. **System Ready** – Operating system starts, and the computer is ready to use.

---

### 🧾 Types of Booting:

🔄 1. **Cold Booting (Hard Booting):**

➡️ **Meaning**: Starting the computer when it is completely turned off.

➡️ **Example**: You press the **power button** to turn on your computer after it was shut down – that's **cold booting**.

🔁 2. **Warm Booting (Soft Booting)**:

➡️ **Meaning**: Restarting the computer without turning off the power.

➡️ **Example**: You press **Ctrl + Alt + Del** or click **Restart** on Windows – that's **warm booting**.

🔧 3. **Dual Booting**:

➡️ **Meaning**: Having **two operating systems** installed and choosing one to run.

➡️ **Example**: Your laptop has Windows and Linux installed. At startup, you choose which one to use.

☁️ 4. **Network Booting (PXE Booting)**:

➡️ **Meaning**: Booting a computer from a **network server** instead of **local storage**.

➡️ **Example**: In a computer lab, systems boot from the college server using a LAN cable.

## Structure of Linux shell

![alt text](Linuxshell.png)

----

### Study of Kernel
The kernel is the core part of an operating system.

It manages the communication between hardware and software.

Also, it manages the following resources of the linux system :-

- Memory management
- File manangement
- Device management
- Process management
- I/O management etc

-----------------------------------

### Study of Shell

The shell is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the operating system.

It takes user commands and tells the operating system to perform tasks.

It lets you type commands to tell the computer what to do , like opening files , mananging programs.
 
 ### Types of Shell

Shells are mainly divided into two categories:

 **1. Command-Line Interface (CLI) Shells**

User interacts by typing commands

Fast and powerful for developers and system admins

Examples (Types of CLI Shells):

|Shell Name	|          Description                 |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|
|     sh	  |Bourne Shell (original Unix shell)    |
|    bash   |	Bourne Again Shell (most popular)    |
|   csh     |	      C Shell (C-like syntax)        |
|    ksh    |	   Korn Shell (advanced features)    |
|    zsh    |Z Shell (user-friendly & customizable)|
|-----------|--------------------------------------|

### 🐚 What is **Bash**?

**Bash** stands for **Bourne Again SHell**.
It is a **command-line shell** used in **Linux** and **Unix-based systems** to **interact with the operating system**.

---

### 🔹 **Simple Definition:**

> **Bash** is a program that lets you **type commands** to control your computer without using the mouse.

---

### ✅ **Key Features:**

* Used to **run commands** like creating files, copying, moving, or deleting.
* Supports **scripting**, so you can **automate tasks** with `.sh` files.
* Built-in on **Linux**, **macOS**, and available for **Windows** (via WSL or Git Bash).

---

### 🧠 **Example Bash Commands:**

```bash
ls       # list files
cd       # change directory
mkdir    # make a new folder
rm       # remove files/folders
echo     # print text
```

---

### 📜 **Example of a Bash Script:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, Kanika!"
mkdir my_folder
cd my_folder
touch file.txt
```

---

### 🔁 **Why Bash is Important:**

* Core part of **Linux system administration**.
* Helps in **automation** (via shell scripting).
* Essential for **DevOps**, **ethical hacking**, **software development**, and more.

---

Let me know if you want a **Bash cheat sheet** or beginner guide PDF!

**2. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Shells**

User interacts using windows, icons, and buttons

Easy for beginners

**Example** : GNOME, KDE (on Linux)

----

## 📁 Linux File System Structure 

A file system structure is the way an operating system organizes and manages data (files and folders) on a storage device like a hard disk or SSD.

It defines:

   * How files are stored

   * How folders (directories) are arranged

   * How the system keeps track of file locations and permissions

The Linux file system is organized **like a tree**, starting from the **root** directory `/`.  
All files and folders are inside this root, even if they are on different drives.

![alt text](struct.png)

The file system structure is like a **digital cabinet** that helps the OS and users **to keep data organized and easy to access**

### 🌳 Main Folders in Linux File System

| Directory | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `/`       | **Root** – Starting point of the file system |
| `/bin`    | Essential **binaries** (like `ls`, `cp`, etc.) |
| `/boot`   | Files needed to **boot** the system |
| `/etc`    | System **configuration** files |
| `/home`   | Personal folders for **users** (like `/home/kanika`) |
| `/lib`    | Shared **libraries** for programs |
| `/media`  | Used to mount **USB drives, CDs** etc. |
| `/opt`    | **Optional software** packages |
| `/root`   | **Home directory** of the root user |
| `/sbin`   | System **admin commands** |
| `/tmp`    | Temporary files (auto-deleted) |
| `/usr`    | User-related programs and data |
| `/var`    | Variable data (like **logs**, mails) |

---

#### 📌 Key Points

- The top-level directory is `/` (called **root**).
- Everything is organized under `/` like branches of a tree.
- Linux does **not** use drive letters like Windows (C:, D:) — everything is part of the same tree.

## 💽 What is Slash Full Disk in Linux?

In Linux, when someone says **"slash full disk"** or **"/ is full"**, it means the **root directory (`/`)** has **no free space left**.

---

### ✅ What is `/` (Slash) in Linux?

- `/` is called the **root directory**.
- It is the **starting point** of the entire Linux file system.
- All other folders like `/home`, `/etc`, `/bin`, etc., exist inside `/`.

---

### 🚨 What Does "Slash Full Disk" Mean?

- The **main partition** of Linux (where it’s installed) is **completely full**.
- No space is available to save files, install software, or update the system.

---

### ⚠️ Why Is It a Problem?

- System becomes **slow** or may **crash**.
- You can’t install or update software.
- Some apps and services may stop working.

---

### 🛠️ How to Check If `/` Is Full?
           df -h /
          
📌 Quick Summary
|Term |	Meaning|
| / (Slash)|	Root directory (main Linux filesystem)|
|Slash Full Disk|	The root disk is full – no free space left|
## 🖥️ Basic Shell Commands in Linux (With Syntax)

| Command | Description | Syntax | Example |

## 📦 What is an ISO File?

An **ISO file** (also called an **ISO image**) is a **complete copy or digital version of a CD, DVD, or other disk**, stored in a **single file**.  
It contains **all the data, files, and folders** needed to create a full copy of the original disk.

---

### ✅ In Linux, What Is It Used For?

- ISO files are used to **distribute operating systems** like **Ubuntu**, **Fedora**, **Kali**, etc.
- You download the ISO file and then **write it to a USB drive** to install Linux on your system.

## 🖥️ What is Bare Metal Installation in Linux?

**Bare Metal Installation** means installing Linux **directly on a computer's hardware** — not inside any other operating system or virtual machine.

You are installing Linux on a **fresh or empty computer**, just like installing Windows on a new laptop.

---

### ✅ Why is it called "Bare Metal"?

Because the installation is done **on the actual physical machine** — the "bare metal" — without any layers like:

- No Windows
- No VirtualBox
- No VMware

---

**🛠️ Simple Example: Installing Ubuntu on Bare Metal**

#### 📌 Where Bare Metal is Used:

- In **servers** (no need for Windows)
- For **learning real Linux**
- In **offices or companies** that use Linux systems
- When you want **full performance** (no lag from virtual machines)

---

#### 🔁 Difference (Simple Table)

| Feature           | Bare Metal Linux     | Virtual Machine Linux     |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| Runs directly on hardware | ✅ Yes           | ❌ No (runs inside another OS) |
| Needs Windows?   | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes (as host OS)         |
| Speed            | 🚀 Fast               | 🐢 Slower (shared resources) |
| Good for         | Real use, servers     | Practice, testing          |

---

### 💡 Tip:

> If you want to use Linux like a real system (not inside Windows), go for **bare metal installation**. It's faster and gives you full control over the machine.

### 💾 What is a **Partitioning Scheme**?

> A **partitioning scheme** is a method used to **organize a hard drive** into parts, so operating systems can manage and access data properly.

---

### 🔹 **Why Partitioning is Needed?**

* To **install multiple OS** (e.g., Linux + Windows).
* To **separate system files and personal files**.
* For **better data management and backup**.
* To **improve performance** and **security**.

---

### 🧱 **Common Partitioning Schemes:**

| Scheme                           | Description                                   | Max Partitions | OS Support            |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| **MBR** (Master Boot Record)     | Older scheme, supports BIOS booting           | 4 primary      | Windows, Linux        |
| **GPT** (GUID Partition Table)   | Modern, supports UEFI booting and large disks | 128 primary    | Windows, Linux, macOS |
| **LVM** (Logical Volume Manager) | Used in Linux, flexible for resizing          | Dynamic        | Linux only            |

---

### 📌 **Example:**

When you install Linux:

* You create a partition for **root (`/`)**
* One for **home (`/home`)**
* One for **swap**

That setup is based on a **Linux partitioning scheme**.

---

## 🔐 Linux File Permission Commands – `chmod`, `chmod 444`, `chmod 644`, `chown`

Linux uses file permissions to control **who can read, write, or execute files and directories**. The `chmod` command allows us to modify these permissions. Every file and directory has **permissions** assigned to three types of users — **owner(u)**, **group(g)**, and **others(o)**. These permissions determine whether a user can **read**, **write**, or **execute** the file.

---

### ✅ **1. `chmod` (Change File Permissions)**
To **change file or directory permissions** in Linux for the owner, group, and others.

#### 🔸 **Syntax**:

```bash
chmod [permissions] [file_name]
```
**For example:** chmod + x filename.sh

## 🔧 `chmod +x filename.sh`

### 📘 What Does It Do?
The command `chmod +x filename.sh` is used to **add execute permission** to a file (usually a script like `.sh`), so it can be **run as a program**.

---

### 🔍 Syntax Breakdown

| Component     | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `chmod`       | Stands for **Change Mode** – used to change file permissions |
| `+x`          | Adds **execute** permission                                  |
| `filename.sh` | The name of the shell script file                            |

---

![alt text](chmod+x.png)

![alt text](+x.png)


### ✅ Purpose

This command makes a file **executable** by the **user, group, and others (by default)**.
You can then run the script directly using:

```bash
./filename.sh
```

Without execute permission, you'll see:

```
bash: ./filename.sh: Permission denied

```
### 💡 Pro Tip

To give execute permission **only to the file owner**, use:

```bash
chmod u+x filename.sh
```
This is a safer option when sharing code in teams or on public systems.

---


#### 🔢 **Octal Permission Codes**:

| Number | Symbol | Meaning              |
| ------ | ------ | -------------------- |
| 7      | rwx    | Read, Write, Execute |
| 6      | rw-    | Read, Write          |
| 5      | r-x    | Read, Execute        |
| 4      | r--    | Read only            |
| 0      | ---    | No permissions       |

---

### 🧪 **Examples**:

#### 🔹 `chmod 444 file.txt`
To make a file **read-only** for everyone (owner, group, and others). Prevents editing or deletion.


```bash
chmod 444 file.txt
```

⟶ `r-- r-- r--`



![alt text](chmod444.png)

![alt text](0.444.png)



#### 🔹 `chmod 644 file.txt`

To allow the owner to **read and write**, and **group & others to only read**. Commonly used for text/config files.
🔸 Now only the owner can edit, while others can only read the file.

```bash
chmod 644 file.txt
```

⟶ `rw- r-- r--`

![alt text](chmod644.png)

![alt text](444.png)

### ✅ **2. `chown` (Change File Owner)** [ASSIGNMENT]

`chown` changes the **owner** or **group** of a file or directory.

**Syntax**:
#### 🔸**change owner**:

```bash
chown [new_owner] [file_name]
```
![alt text](chown.png)

#### 🔸 **Change Owner and Group**:

```bash
chown user:group file.txt
```

✅ **Examples**:

    chown kanika file.txt → Changes the owner to kanika

    chown root:admin file.txt → Changes owner to root and group to admin
---

### 📎 **Check Permissions**:
✅ *Tip*: Use ls -l to view current permissions:

 ```bash
 ls -l file.txt
 ```
---

> 🔁 **Quick Tip**:

> `chmod` = change permissions

> `chown` = change owner

**Point to remember**:

When working with system files, it's often necessary to use **sudo** to **execute chmod** with root privileges.

---
## 🔄 Redirection in Linux

In Linux, **redirection** is a powerful feature used to control **input and output** of commands. It allows you to **save output to files, read from files, or even combine and filter output streams**. This is widely used in scripting and system automation. Redirection operator is ">"

### 🔄 Types of Redirection in Linux

Redirection is used in Linux to control where input comes from and where output or error messages go. It helps in saving outputs to files, reading inputs from files, and managing errors effectively.

--

| **Operator** | **Meaning**                    | **Example**                        | **Result**                                             |
|--------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `>`          | Output redirection             | `ls > files.txt`                   | Saves output to `files.txt` (overwrites if it exists)  |
| `>>`         | Append output                  | `echo "Hello" >> notes.txt`        | Adds `"Hello"` to end of `notes.txt`                  |
| `<`          | Input redirection              | `wc -l < notes.txt`                | Reads input from `notes.txt` instead of keyboard       |

> 🧠 **Tip**: Use redirection to log outputs, handle errors gracefully, and automate input/output in shell scripts.

## 📢 `echo` Command in Linux

The `echo` command is used to **display text, strings, or variables** on the terminal. It’s one of the most commonly used commands in **shell scripting, logging, and debugging**.

---

### ✅ What Does `echo` Do?

- Prints **text or output** to the screen.
- Displays the value of **environment variables**.
- Writes output to **files using redirection**.
- Supports **escape characters** for formatting.

---

### 📌 Syntax:
```bash
echo [option] [string or variable]
````

---

### 🔹 Basic Examples

| **Command**          | **Description**            | **Output**           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `echo Hello, Linux!` | Print a simple message     | `Hello, Linux!`      |
| `echo $USER`         | Show current username      | `kanika` *(example)* |
| `echo "Home: $HOME"` | Print environment variable | `Home: /home/kanika` |

---

### 🔍 Formatting Output with `-e` Flag

Use `-e` to interpret special escape characters like new lines or tabs.

## 🚰 Pipe (`|`) in Linux

In Linux, the **pipe operator (`|`)** is used to **pass the output of one command as input to another**.  
It helps you build powerful command chains by combining simple commands to perform complex tasks.

---

### ✅ What Does a Pipe Do?

- Connects **stdout (output)** of one command to the **stdin (input)** of another.
- Helps create efficient **one-liners** without the need for intermediate files.
- Commonly used in **filtering**, **sorting**, **counting**, and **processing data**.

---

### 📌 Syntax:

```bash
command1 | command2
````

➡ The output of `command1` becomes the input of `command2`.

---
**Example**: sort – Sort file content
    cat file.txt | sort

✅ What it does:

  - Reads the content of file.txt
  - Sorts the lines alphabetically using sort

📤 Output:
Sorted version of the file content, line by line.

### 🧠 Pro Tips:

* Pipes work **left to right**: output of the left command goes to the right.

* You can **chain multiple pipes**
