## Training day :- 01
I am **Kanika**. Today was my first day of summer training in the **Computer Science Department(Parent branch)** . I was very excited about this training . Firstly there was an **orientation program** conducted for us in the **auditorium** . Here , I interacted with **Dr. Priyanka** who is professor in **Computer Scienec department** . She gave all the necessary information that was required and also welcomed all the students who are going to be part of the parent branch . She told us about socities , attendance creteria and many other things . Then , I interacted with **Head of Department, Dr. Kiran Jyoti** along with all the students . She also introduced a new scheme for **2024 year onwards students**. After this valuable interaction , all the students shifted to their respective labs . In the lab , our teacher explained the syllabus of this training that all the students will study in further days . Then she said that first day we will discuss about **Linux**.
Firstly i learned about **Linux** & **its importance** then why most of the **companies** & **coders** use **Linux** over **Windows** ? Following are the reasons behind it :- 
- Linux is **more secure** due to its permission-based system and fewer malware targets than windows.
- Linux is **open source** , so it can be easily available.
- Linux is **free** , while windows required paid license.
- Linux has large community.

  ### Difference between linux and window
  | Feature | Linux | Window |
  |---------|-------|--------|
  |   Type	|Open-source OS	|Proprietary OS|
  |  Cost	  | Free to use	  |Paid (license required)|
  |Security	| More secure,less virus-prone	|More vulnerable to malware|
  |Customization |	Highly customizable	| Limited customization|
  |Command Line	|Command line used often (Terminal)|Mostly GUI-based| 
  |Performance	|Lightweight, works well on older systems	|Requires more system resources|
  |User Interface |Depends on distro (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora)|Standard and consistent UI|
  |Support for Software|Limited for some commercial software|Widely supported software (e.g., MS Office)|
  |Best for |	Developers, programmers, servers|General users, gamers,¬†businesses|

## Booting and its types 
I have also learned about booting and types-

### üñ•Ô∏è What is Booting?

**Booting** is the process of starting a computer.
When you switch on your computer, the system loads the operating system (like Windows or Linux) from the hard drive into the RAM (memory), so you can use the computer.

### üîÅ Booting Process :

1. **Power On** ‚Äì You turn on the computer.
2. **POST (Power-On Self-Test)** ‚Äì System checks hardware (RAM, keyboard, etc.).
3. **BIOS/UEFI Loads** ‚Äì Basic system firmware starts.
4. **Boot Loader Activated** ‚Äì BIOS/UEFI finds and runs the boot loader.
5. **OS Loading** ‚Äì Boot loader loads the operating system into RAM.
6. **System Ready** ‚Äì Operating system starts, and the computer is ready to use.

---

### üßæ Types of Booting:

1. **Cold Booting (Hard Booting):**

   * Happens when the computer is started from the power-off state.
   * Example: You press the power button to turn on your PC.

2. **Warm Booting (Soft Booting):**

   * Happens when the system restarts without turning off the power.
   * Example: You click **Restart** or press **Ctrl + Alt + Del**.

Day **two** of the **summer training program** picked up right where we left off , diving deeper into the concepts introduced yesterday. It brought with a fresh set of challenges and exciting new information . The instructor continued to provide insightful explanations making complex concepts easy to grasp . It was a productive day thaT further fueled my enthusiasm for the rest of the training .

### Structure of Linux shell
![alt text](Linuxshell.png)

### Study of Kernel
The kernel is the core part of an operating system.

It manages the communication between hardware and software.

Also, it manages the following resources of the linux system :-
- Memory management
- File manangement
- Device management
- Process management
- I/O management etc

### Study of Shell

The shell is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the operating system.

It takes user commands and tells the operating system to perform tasks.

It lets you type commands to tell the computer what to do , like opening files , mananging programs.
 
 ### Types of Shell

Shells are mainly divided into two categories:

 **1. Command-Line Interface (CLI) Shells**

User interacts by typing commands

Fast and powerful for developers and system admins

Examples (Types of CLI Shells):

|Shell Name	|          Description                 |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|
|     sh	  |Bourne Shell (original Unix shell)    |
|    bash   |	Bourne Again Shell (most popular)    |
|   csh     |	      C Shell (C-like syntax)        |
|    ksh    |	   Korn Shell (advanced features)    |
|    zsh    |Z Shell (user-friendly & customizable)|
|-----------|--------------------------------------|

**2. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Shells**

User interacts using windows, icons, and buttons

Easy for beginners

**Example** : GNOME, KDE (on Linux)

## üìÅ Linux File System Structure 

The Linux file system is organized **like a tree**, starting from the **root** directory `/`.  
All files and folders are inside this root, even if they are on different drives.

### üå≥ Main Folders in Linux File System

| Directory | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `/`       | **Root** ‚Äì Starting point of the file system |
| `/bin`    | Essential **binaries** (like `ls`, `cp`, etc.) |
| `/boot`   | Files needed to **boot** the system |
| `/etc`    | System **configuration** files |
| `/home`   | Personal folders for **users** (like `/home/kanika`) |
| `/lib`    | Shared **libraries** for programs |
| `/media`  | Used to mount **USB drives, CDs** etc. |
| `/opt`    | **Optional software** packages |
| `/root`   | **Home directory** of the root user |
| `/sbin`   | System **admin commands** |
| `/tmp`    | Temporary files (auto-deleted) |
| `/usr`    | User-related programs and data |
| `/var`    | Variable data (like **logs**, mails) |

---

#### üìå Key Points

- The top-level directory is `/` (called **root**).
- Everything is organized under `/` like branches of a tree.
- Linux does **not** use drive letters like Windows (C:, D:) ‚Äî everything is part of the same tree.
## üñ•Ô∏è Basic Shell Commands in Linux (With Syntax)

| Command | Description | Syntax | Example |
|--------|-------------|--------|---------|
| `ls` | Lists files and folders | `ls [options]` | `ls -l` |
| `cd` | Changes directory | `cd [directory]` | `cd /home/user` |
| `mkdir` | Creates a new folder | `mkdir [folder_name]` | `mkdir myfolder` |
| `rmdir` | Removes an empty folder | `rmdir [folder_name]` | `rmdir myfolder` |
| `touch` | Creates a new empty file | `touch [file_name]` | `touch file.txt` |
| `rm` | Removes files or folders | `rm [file/folder]` | `rm file.txt` |
| `cp` | Copies files/folders | `cp [source] [destination]` | `cp file.txt /home/user/` |
| `mv` | Moves or renames files/folders | `mv [source] [destination]` | `mv file.txt newname.txt` |
| `cat` | Displays contents of a file | `cat [file_name]` | `cat file.txt` |
| `clear` | Clears the terminal screen | `clear` | `clear` |
| `man` | Shows manual/help for a command | `man [command]` | `man ls` |
| `exit` | Closes the terminal session | `exit` | `exit` |
| `pwd` | Shows current directory path | `pwd` | `pwd` |
